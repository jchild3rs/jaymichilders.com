# Styled-System + Styled Components vs Tailwind for React Apps

<small>Posted May 10th, 2020</small>

In my last large React project, I decided it was time to try Styled Components. CSS
Modules felt overly tedious, and plain CSS felt like a chore.

**TLDR: For me, it comes down to a few things:**

- the API being almost identical.
- Prop bloat vs class name bloat.
- CSS-in-JS vs regular stylesheet

## Component Polymophism vs. Simple Semantic Markup

At first, I was blown away at the power of the <InlineCodeSnippet>as</InlineCodeSnippet> tag.

<span>
  <pre>
    <code className="xml rounded font-mono">{`<Box as="h1">Heading</Box>`}</code>
  </pre>
</span>
<br />

vs:

<span>
  <pre>
    <code className="xml rounded font-mono">{`<h1>Heading</h1>`}</code>
  </pre>
</span>

<br />
